# Thesis---Face-Image-Quality-Assessment
This is my graduation thesis about Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) problems.

# Idea 
My approach was based on method proposed in [CR-FIQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.06592.pdf) paper. My own improvement was inspired by [MagFace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06627.pdf)'s idea. My model can complete two following tasks simultaneously:
- Extracting embeddings for Face Recognition tasks.
- Estimating quality of face images and quantizing them as quality scores.

# Result
This is my simple UI
